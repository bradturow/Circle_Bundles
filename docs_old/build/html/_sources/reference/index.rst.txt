Reference
=========

This section documents the **user-facing API** of ``circle_bundles``.

The library is organized around a small number of core concepts:

- **Covers** of the base space
- **Bundle objects** constructed from data and a cover
- **Metrics** on base, fiber, and total spaces
- **Analysis utilities** for local and fiberwise structure
- **Visualization utilities**
- **Optical flow utilities**
- **Synthetic data generators**
- **Geometric unwrapping utilities**

Only public, stable interfaces are documented here.
