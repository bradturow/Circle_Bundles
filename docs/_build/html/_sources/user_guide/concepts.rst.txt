Concepts
========

This package reconstructs circle-bundle structure from data using:

- a cover of a base space,
- local circle coordinates on each chart,
- estimated transition functions in :math:`O(2)`,
- diagnostics and characteristic classes (e.g. twisted Euler-type obstructions),
- and optional persistence-style edge filtrations.

This page is intentionally high level.
Detailed mathematical background can be linked/expanded later as the docs mature.
